<h1>Usage Instructions</h1>

<h4>Visual Studio Code</h4>

<p>
  Integrating this app with Dropbox unleashes its true power. After integration, you'll be able to directly edit your snippets within Snippet Machine and have the changes be immediately usable within your editor.
</p> 

<p>
  After authenticating with Dropbox, you'll need to set up a symlink between your dropbox directory and the directory where Visual Studio Code snippets are stored. First, you'll want to copy any existing snippets into your dropbox folder.
</p>

<pre>
cp ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/snippets ~/Dropbox/dlmSnippetMachine/vscode/snippets
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/snippets
ln -s ~/Dropbox/dlmSnippetMachine/vscode/snippets ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/
</pre>

<p>
  After this symlink is complete, any changes you save to Dropbox from within Snippet Machine will be available within Visual Studio Code.
</p>

<h4>Sublime Text 2</h4>

<p>
  Again, Dropbox integration is crucial to getting the most out of SnippetMachine.
</p>

<pre>
cp ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/User ~/Dropbox/dlmSnippetMachine/sublime2/User
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/User
ln -s ~/Dropbox/dlmSnippetMachine/sublime2/User ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/
</pre>

<p>
  After the symlink is complete, any snippets that you save to Dropbox from within SnippetMachine will be instantly available within Sublime Text 2.
